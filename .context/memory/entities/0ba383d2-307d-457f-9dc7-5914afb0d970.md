# MCP Memory Server Project Overview

The MCP Memory Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to provide structured memory management across chat sessions for all MCP-enabled tools and applications. It is specifically built for project-based work, allowing memories to be stored within project directories.

Key Features:
- **Project-Specific Memory**: Stores memories locally within the project.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports `.mcp-memory.json` (hidden) or `mcp-memory.json` (visible).
- **Multi-Tool Support**: Compatible with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and more.
- **Git Integration**: Enables sharing of project memories via version control.
- **Structured Storage**: Organizes data into entities, concepts, and sessions.

The project uses `npm` for package management and includes comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` folder.
