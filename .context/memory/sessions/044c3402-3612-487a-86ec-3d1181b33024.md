# Kinde Role-Based Admin Authorization

# Kinde Role-Based Admin Authorization

Implemented role-based access control using Kinde's built-in role and permission system for admin dashboard access.

## Implementation Details

### Permission System
- Uses Kinde's `getPermissions()` API to check user roles
- Checks for `admin:access` permission key
- Real-time permission validation on each login

### Code Changes
Updated `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:
```typescript
// Check if user has admin role from Kinde
const permissions = await getPermissions();
const isAdmin = permissions.permissions.some((perm: any) => 
  perm.key === 'admin:access' && perm.isGranted
);
```

### Kinde Setup Required
1. **Create Admin Role**: 
   - Name: `Admin`
   - Key: `admin`
2. **Create Permission**:
   - Name: `Admin Access`
   - Key: `admin:access`
3. **Assign Role**: Grant Admin role to authorized users

### Benefits
- Centralized role management in Kinde dashboard
- No hardcoded admin emails in source code
- Real-time updates (changes take effect on next login)
- Scalable for additional roles (Editor, Moderator, etc.)
- Audit trail through Kinde

### Security Features
- Protected route: `/admin` only accessible to users with admin permission
- Automatic redirect to `/dashboard` for non-admin users
- Permission caching in local database for offline scenarios

### Setup Guide
Complete setup instructions available in project documentation covering:
- Role creation in Kinde dashboard
- Permission configuration
- User assignment methods
- Troubleshooting common issues

This approach provides a professional, maintainable, and secure admin authorization system.
