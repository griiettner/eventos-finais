# Application Architecture & Design Patterns

The application follows a layered architecture: React UI layer with protected routes, AuthContext for state management, DBService facade for SQLite operations, and Web Worker for non-blocking database queries. Key patterns include Provider pattern for auth, Facade pattern for database access, and offline-first design with sync capabilities. Data flows from user interactions through components to local SQLite storage, with optional server sync when online.
