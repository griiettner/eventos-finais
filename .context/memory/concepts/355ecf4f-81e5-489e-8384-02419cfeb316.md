# Technology Stack & Dependencies

Tech stack includes React 19 with TypeScript, Vite (Rolldown) for fast builds, React Router v6 for routing, SQLite WASM for local database, Kinde Auth for OAuth, Framer Motion for animations, and Vite PWA plugin for offline capabilities. The app uses CSS-in-JS with glassmorphism design, Lucide React icons, and ESLint for code quality. SQLite runs in Web Worker with OPFS persistence for non-blocking operations.
