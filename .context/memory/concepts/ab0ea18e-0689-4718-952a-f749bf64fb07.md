# Eventos Finais - Project Overview

Eventos Finais is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) for interactive Bible study focused on end-times events. Built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite, it features offline-first architecture with SQLite WASM for local data storage, Kinde OAuth authentication, and modern glassmorphism UI with Framer Motion animations. The app serves Portuguese-speaking users with 20 chapters of study content, audio playback, progress tracking, and sync capabilities.
